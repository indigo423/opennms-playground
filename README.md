# 🕹️ Playground for OpenNMS Horizon

This is a collection of deployment scenarios for OpenNMS Horizon.
It can be used to learn and test functions and features of the network monitoring stack OpenNMS Horizon.
This is not a production ready deployment, but it will help you understand which components are required and how need to think about 3rd party service dependencies and data persistence.

## Principles

The stacks with the configurations are built to use external dependencies from a `include` directory, that way we don't have to repeat ourselves that often when we go into different deployment scenarios.
Nevertheless, to get specialized behavior in every stack, we use the compose.override.yml pattern which is automatically applied when you run `docker compose up -d` and doesn't require any additional user interaction.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For configuring the OpenNMS Horizon {Core, Minion, Sentinel}, explicitely remove dependencies to the shipped `confd` application in the container. I will just use plain file injection to do the configuration and intentionally remove this layer of complexity.

## How can I create a secure credential vault

The following commands will create a `scv.jce` file in your current working directoy with credentials for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
There will be two credential sets created, the user for the OpenNMS Horizon database with the user `opennms` and a PostgreSQL admin user which can manipulate an create schemas during initialization and updates `postgres`.

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/opt/opennms/etc \
  --entrypoint /opt/opennms/bin/scvcli \
  quay.io/labmonkeys/onms-horizon:33.0.7 \
  set postgres opennms "change_me!_Cux2j4WEA59j28WF5Kt%"

docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/opt/opennms/etc \
  --entrypoint /opt/opennms/bin/scvcli \
  quay.io/labmonkeys/onms-horizon:33.0.7 \
  set postgres-admin postgres "change_me!_VRL7FhR@mGw@djhS2A4"
```
